FinanceLingo is an Android app created using Java, XML, and Google Firebase. Immersed in engaging UI, users interact with the app by completing lessons and activities on financial education topics such as budgeting, taxes, investing, and debt. Most importantly, their progress and data is stored and retrieved in real-time from a Google Firebase cloud database to be displayed on the app when necessary.
