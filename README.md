### About: FinanceLingo is an Android app created using Java, XML, and Google Firebase. Users can interact with the app by completing lessons and activities on financial-education topics such as budgeting, taxes, investing, and debt. Most importantly, their progress is stored and retrieved in real-time from a Firebase cloud database to be displayed on our UI.
